    "2. **Range $ t' < t $**: This range includes trades that occurred before time $ t $ and hence impact both the price at $ t $ and $ t+l $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying the Auto-correlation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply the auto-correlation function in Step 3, we approximate $ V_{t'}^α $ by $ \\bar{V}^α $ and replace $ \\epsilon_{t'}\\epsilon_{t} $ with $ c(t'-t) $ or $ c(t'-t-l) $, depending on the range of $ t' $. \n",

    "- However, for the range $ t' < t $, we need to consider the impact of these earlier trades on the price at $ t+l $. Here, $ t' $ can be greater than $ l $, as these trades occurred before $ t $ and can have a lag greater than $ l $ with respect to $ t+l $. This is where the term $ t' > l $ comes into play, resulting in the second sum in the final expression: $ \\sum_{t'>l} G(t')c(t' - l) $.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $ t' > l $ in the final expression arises from considering the impact of trades that occurred before time $ t $ on the price at $ t+l $. These trades, while occurring before $ t $, can have a lag greater than $ l $ when their impact on the price at $ t+l $ is considered.
